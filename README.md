# Tribute Page: Building a tribute page by using HTML5 & CSS

## üöÄ Overview

This is my very first HTML and CSS page that I have ever made. A biblbiography of John D. Rockefeller, one of the richest man in the history of the United State

In this project, **[HyperText Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#:~:text=The%20HyperText%20Markup%20Language%20or,(HyperText%20Markup%20Language)) and [Cascading Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)** are used to implement the page.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Learning Objectives

After fulfilling the project, I accquire knowledge to:
* Build and style static webpages with semantic **HTML** and **CSS**
* Implement best practices and standards when structuring HTML files using nested elements, indentation, comments, and line breaks
* Implement the use of adding **Images & Links** into HTML, using **`<li>, <figure>, so on`tags** to present the content of the project
* Implement CSS styling via class, id and element selectors using external stylesheets and inline styles
* Implement **Bootstrap** styling and **Google font**
* Use **Git workflow** to initialize projects, track changes, and host via remote server
* Execute live deployment using **GitHub** Pages

## üìã Requirements

**Build an app that is functionally similar to [this](https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks/)**

**User Stories:** 
1. Your tribute page should have an element with a corresponding `id="main"`, which contains all other elements
2. You should see an element with an `id` of `title`, which contains a string (i.e. text), that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug")
3. You should see either a `figure` or a `div` element with an `id` of `img-div`
4. Within the `img-div` element, you should see an `img` element with a corresponding `id="image"`
5. Within the `img-div` element, you should see an element with a corresponding `id="img-caption"` that contains textual content describing the image shown in `img-div`
6. You should see an element with a corresponding `id="tribute-info"`, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page
7. You should see an a element with a corresponding `id="tribute-link"`, which links to an outside site, that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of `target` and set it to `_blank` in order for your link to open in a new tab
8. Your `#image` should use `max-width` and `height` properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size
9. Your `img` element should be centered within its parent element
