                <p>Rockefeller is interesting as a leader because he found great balance between all six dimensions of
                    leadership. He was intelligent enough to create the first Oil Monopoly in the US, and to know that
                    competition is not always a bad thing. He was also confident in what he was doing, and most of his
                    employees liked or respected him. He was determined to become the richest man in the US, and he
                    became the richest man not only in the US, but in world history. He was also great socially and very
                    tactful, even in heated situations. Finally, he had a great amount of integrity and did not alter
                    facts in order to gain an advantage. All in all, Rockefeller can be revered as somebody who greatly
                    balanced all dimensions of leadership.</p>
